# Student Record Project
Student data refers to the comprehensive collection of information about individuals enrolled in an educational institution. The record aims to generate insights across student enrolment, helping to make informed decisions concerning the student admission. 

## Overview of the Student Record
The provided student dataset contains key attributes that offer insights into the profiles, academic performance, and admissions trends of prospective students. Analyzing this dataset using Power BI allows for an in-depth exploration of patterns and relationships across various dimensions. Below is a detailed breakdown of the dataset:

## Column Descriptions
- Name:
Represents the identity of each student.
Used primarily for individual-level analysis and filtering.

- Age:
Numeric data indicating the age of the student.
Useful for grouping students into age brackets to analyze trends or disparities across age groups.

- Gender:
Categorical data capturing the gender of the student (e.g., Male, Female, or Other).
Facilitates demographic segmentation and analysis of gender-based trends in test scores, percentages, or admission status.

- Admission Test Score:
Numeric data representing the score achieved by the student in the admission test.
A critical metric for evaluating academic readiness and comparing performance across applicants.
Enables the identification of score distributions, outliers, and correlations with other variables such as admission status.

- High School Percentage:
Numeric data representing the percentage scored by the student in their high school examinations.
An indicator of prior academic achievement.
Useful for correlating past performance with admission test scores and admission outcomes.
- City:
Categorical data identifying the city of residence or origin of the student.
Enables geographic analysis to identify trends in applications and admissions from different regions.
Admission Status:
Categorical data indicating whether the student was admitted (e.g., "Accepted," "Rejected,").
The primary outcome variable for assessing factors that influence admission decisions.

### Data cleaning and Preparation
At the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, the following actions was performed:
   - Data loading and inspection
   - Handling missing variables
   - Data cleaning and formatting

## Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and infographics, data visualization tools and techniques help to make complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable.
